- able to create new tabs in program by selecting "+" tab
	code source - combination of two:
	https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa984280%28v=vs.71%29.aspx
	left justifies new tab
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6738126/winforms-tabcontrol-add-new-tab-button
- cleaned out some garbage old functions
	- problem: removing the code that's still referenced crashes the Form1.design
	- soln: go to the properties/events, find where the code is referenced, delete it there
		- then delete the code itself in the main form
- autoresize forms using "Dock"
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1636280/automatic-resizing-of-the-windows-forms-controls
- added a function for the "maximize" event
	source: https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/d0af9856-a892-4030-abff-a550847df3a4/form-maximizeminimize-click-event?forum=winforms
- separated some parts of the class into different files:
	NotedumpMain.cs, Form1.cs (legacy), NotedumpMenuStrip.cs
	source (can extend partial class into multiple files using "partial" keyword):
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/144783/c-sharp-classes-in-separate-files
- started implementing richtextbox
	- need to read and output file into box


2016.11.23
- working on file I/O
	- turning text file into a resource and accessing it as if it is on the file directory
		- alternative: text file resource is treated as string and can be directly loaded into richtextbox
		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6428881/how-to-insert-a-string-into-a-richtextbox
	- todo: save richtextbox contents to resource
		- "Save All and Exit" flushes out content in active window and closes program
		- save as stream, output to resource?


2016.11.24
- moving to hardcoded tabs instead of dynamic tab system
- added richtextbox to all "sub"tabs by doubleclick


2016.11.25
- changed "+" tab event handler for Main, Music, and Links to single event handler
	- dynamic tab system is dead, code will remain for future use
- singular richtextbox event handler created for Music and Links
- movie rtb has its own event handler


2016.11.28
- "to do" tab and "to do" + "reminders" subtabs created
- attached rtb event handler to "to do" mouse doubleclick
- temporarily turning "Flush" button into RTB resource saver


2016.11.29
- in process of outputting rtb contents to associated resource file


2016.11.30
- using rtb.LoadFile(...) instead of "rtb.Text = Properties..."
	- on first build, loads contents from original resource content file
	- on subsequent runs+loads, saved content persists and is loaded into rtb
	- "rtb.Text = Properties..." load the string inside the original resource file, rather than persistent file
	- cleaning the solution will deploy the resource files again


2016.12.01
- finished "Save All" and "Save All and Exit"
- working on flush button
	- using array (activearray) to indicate which tab is currently active
	- SelectedIndexChanged is an array of 0s with a single 1, 1 indicating the active tab, 0 for all inactive tabs
	    0: td_reminders, 1: td_td, 2: music_all, 3: music_ind, 4: music_met
        5: links_all, 6: links_yt, 7: links_arts, 8: movies
	- allow content flushed to tab whose contents aren't open?


2016.12.02
- allowed content flushed to tab whose contents aren't open
	- appended text to end of file associated to selected tab
	append:
	https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.file.appendtext%28v=vs.110%29.aspx
	appendall
	https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms143356%28v=vs.110%29.aspx
	- newline in windows is '\r\n'
- implementing a status bar to give indication which tabpage is open (problem if tab page isn't active)
	how to make status bar show text:
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13336290/how-to-update-statusstrip-in-windows-forms
	also, have status bar docked at bottom otherwise text doesn't appear
- removing debugging statements and shifting it to status bar
- refactoring NDFlush to a shorter version using reflection


2016.12.03
- refactored NDFlush code disappeared; rewrote it
	- completed?
- TabPages is a reference type; a class
	- for refactored code, created an array of TabPages where each element points to an existing TabPage
	- in C#, declaring a variable and assigning its value to be another existing variable of reference type does not instantiate
	another value in memory; instead it works like a pointer
	source: notes, and
	https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/490f96s2.aspx
- need to: merge MainMovies doubleclick into the general doubleclick event handler
	- forgot to set nd_active[8] = true
	- will NOT merge with the general doubleclick handler
		- will need to move around the controls and rtb creation code
- changed File.AppendAllText(...,X) to output correct newline
- changed "Save All" to simpler version
- changed "Save All and Exit" to simpler version


2017.01.23
- adding "Get" tab
	- add event controller
		- add array values for the four new tabs
	- add three new text files
		- simply added as text files, not resources
		- change property to "copy if newer" to have file persist
- removed unused hardcoded boolean value for each tab
	- redundant because array exists
- removed "maximize"
